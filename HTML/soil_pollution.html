                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Air pollution is contamination of
                    the
                    indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the
                    natural
                    characteristics of the atmosphere.

                    Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common
                    sources
                    of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon
                    monoxide,
                    ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and
                    other
                    diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.

                    WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline
                    limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from
                    the
                    highest exposures.

                    Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of
                    air
                    pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies
                    to
                    reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the
                    burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term
                    mitigation of climate change.

                <h1 id="2"> What Is Air Pollution?</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Air pollution collectively
                    describes
                    the presence of a diverse and complex mixture of chemicals, particulate matter (PM), or of
                    biological
                    material in the ambient air which can cause harm
                    or discomfort to humans or other living organisms. The sources of air pollution can either be
                    natural
                    (e.g., volcanic eruptions) or manmade (e.g., industrial activities), and air pollution emerges as a
                    serious health problem especially
                    in rapidly growing countries. Millions of people worldwide are chronically exposed to airborne
                    pollutants in concentrations that are well above legal safety standards [1]. Therefore, morbidity
                    and
                    mortality attributable to air pollution
                    continue to be a growing public health concern worldwide. Air pollution refers to the release of
                    pollutants into the air—pollutants which are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole.
                    According to the World Health Organization
                    (WHO), each year air pollution is responsible for nearly seve n million deaths around the globe.
                    Nine
                    out of ten human beings currently breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for
                    pollutants,
                    with those living in low- and middle-income
                    countries suffering the most. In the United States, the Clean Air Act, established in 1970,
                    authorizes
                    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard public health by regulating the
                    emissions of
                    these harmful air pollutants.

                <h1 id="3"> What Causes Air Pollution?</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp“Most air pollution comes from
                    energy
                    use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and
                    Clean
                    Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels
                    releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air
                    pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in
                    the
                    form of carbon dioxide and methane raises
                    the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that
                    increased heat, forming when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate
                    change also increases the production
                    of allergenic air pollutants, including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather
                    and
                    increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season). “We’ve made progress over the last
                    50
                    years improving air quality in
                    the United States thanks to the Clean Air Act,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy
                    director
                    of the NRDC Science Center. “But climate change will make it harder in the future to meet pollution
                    standards, which are designed to
                    protect health.”
                </p><br>
                <h1 id="4"> Impact</h1>
                <p>From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health
                    and
                    climate.

                    Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter
                    which
                    result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases.

                    Additionally, around 2.4 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution,
                    while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood,
                    animal
                    dung and crop waste) and coal.

                    The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is associated with 7
                    million
                    premature deaths annually.

                    Sources of air pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution sources
                    include
                    residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation, agriculture/waste
                    incineration,
                    and industry. Policies and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy
                    and
                    transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste
                    management
                    can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution.</p>

                    human body vary depending on the type of pollutant and the length and level of exposure—as well as
                    other
                    factors, including a person’s individual health
                    risks and the cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants or stressors.

                <ul>
                    <li>Nitrogen emissions from vehicles and factories could aid the growth of plants and trees.</li>
                    <li>The heat-retaining characteristics of air-borne pollutants could keep cities that face extremely

                <ul>
                    <li>Approximately 7 million people die every year due to poor air quality. </li>
                    <li>Chronic and acute health impacts as a result of air pollution have been extensively studied and
                        it
                        has been found to have severe impacts on the respiratory system, cardiovascular system,

                        systems, etc. </li>
                    <li>Certain air pollutants have been found to bio-accumulate into crops grown, which are eventually
                        consumed by humans, and could thus cause bio-accumulation of these toxic particles on our body.
                    </li>
