            <h2 class="abouth2">About website</h2> <br>
            <p class="aboutpara">Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment that can have
                negative impacts on human health, wildlife, and ecosystems. There are many types of pollution, including
                air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution. Common sources of pollution include industrial
                activities, transportation, agriculture, and waste disposal.</p> <br>
            <p class="aboutpara">Pollution control refers to the strategies and techniques used to reduce or eliminate
                pollution. This can include technologies that reduce emissions from industrial activities, such as
                scrubbers and filters, as well as regulatory measures like environmental laws and standards. Pollution
                control can also involve individual actions, such as reducing energy consumption and choosing
                environmentally friendly products.</p> <br>
            <p class="aboutpara">Efforts to control pollution have become increasingly important in recent decades as
                the negative impacts of pollution have become more apparent. Many governments around the world have
                implemented regulations and programs to reduce pollution, and there is growing public awareness and
                concern about the issue. By working together to reduce pollution, we can help protect the environment
                and promote a healthier, more sustainable future.</p>
