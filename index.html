                    <br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
                        These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash.
                        They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.
                        Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.

                    </p><br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more
                        polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For
                        example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the
                        middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms
                        what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pollution, also called environmental pollution,
                        the addition of any substance
                        (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the
                        environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored
                        in
                        some harmless form. The major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air
                        pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Modern society is also concerned about specific
                        types of pollutants, such as noise pollution, light pollution, and plastic pollution. </p> <br>

                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although environmental pollution can be caused
                        by natural events
                        such as forest fires and active volcanoes, use of the word pollution generally implies that the
                        contaminants have an anthropogenic source—that is, a source created by human activities.
                        Pollution has accompanied humankind ever since groups of people first congregated and remained
                        for a long time in any one place. Indeed, ancient human settlements are frequently recognized by
                        their wastes—shell mounds and rubble heaps, for instance. </p><br>

                        protect air, water, and land environments from pollution had developed among the general

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the middle of the 20th century, an awareness
                        of the need to
                        protect air, water, and land environments from pollution had developed among the general public.
                        In particular, the publication in 1962 of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring focused attention
                        on environmental damage caused by improper use of pesticides such as DDT and other persistent
                        chemicals that accumulate in the food chain and disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems on a
                        wide scale. In response, major pieces of environmental legislation, such as the Clean Air Act
                        (1970) and the Clean Water Act (1972; United States), were passed in many countries to control
                        and mitigate environmental pollution.

                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The presence of environmental pollution raises
                        the issue of
                        pollution control. Great efforts are made to limit the release of harmful substances into the
                        environment through air pollution control, wastewater treatment, solid-waste management,
                        hazardous-waste management, and recycling. Unfortunately, attempts at pollution control are
                        often surpassed by the scale of the problem, especially in less-developed countries. Noxious
                        levels of air pollution are common in many large cities, where particulates and gases from
                        transportation, heating, and manufacturing accumulate and linger. The problem of plastic
                        pollution on land and in the oceans has only grown as the use of single-use plastics has
                        burgeoned worldwide. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide
